# Standardly - Getting Started

## 1) Install instructions
- Install the [GitHub CLI commands](https://cli.github.com/)
- Install the [CLI tools for Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)
- Install .Net 7.0 ([Get .NET 7 Preview](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks))
- Install the the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cjdutoit.Standardly)

## 2) Configuration
To work with the Code Generator, you will need to add some config (or you will need to complete this every time).

In Visual Studio, go to TOOLS > OPTIONS > Standardly and complete 
- Display Name 
- Your GitHub Username
- Default Base Branch Name (By default GitHub uses main)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If yours is master, you can change this by running the following command `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`)

Copyright and License are set to MIT License by default.  You can change this if you want smething else.  (This will only be applied to new projects via the .editorconfig file and will not override the license file or copyright for other projects.)

## 3) Creating your project

### Using the Multi-Project Template

3.1 Open Visual Studio and choose "Create a new project"

3.2 In the Create a new project window, search for "Standardly" and select the Standardly - Multi Project Template.

3.3 Type in the name you would like for the solution name.  (Keep it in a namespace format i.e. no spaces)

3.4 Check the box for "Place solution and project in the same directory" otherwise the multi-project teplate will another unneccesary folder.

3.5 Click on Create

You will now see skeleton projects for the following:
- $solution name%.Api
- $solution name%.Api.Infrastructure.Build
- $solution name%.Api.Infrastructure.Provision
- $solution name%.Api.Tests.Acceptance
- $solution name%.Api.Tests.Unit

(By design there will NOT be any folders / placeholders for things that are not there yet i.e. Services.  Theses will be later via the code generation tool.)

3.6 Add your project to GitHub as the Standardly will commit code for the various steps i.e. with services the failing and then the passing tests followed by a Pull Request when all tasks are done.

### Using the Code Generator

3.4 We are now ready to start generating the code.  You can get to the Code Generator by either selecting a project in Solution Explorer, right click > Add > Standardly Code Generator OR once a project is selected, using CTRL + SHIFT + F4 to bring up the Code Generator.

#### 3.5 Build

Now that the Code Generator is open we want to generate code for $solution name%.Api.Infrastructure.Build project 1st so we can build agent can validate future pulll requests.

3.5.1 In the "Search for templates" textbox type "build".  It will filter to "INFRA: Setup Infrastructure Build Project" OR select "INFRA: Setup Infrastructure Build Project" from the Template Drop Down.

3.5.2 As we have done the config already there is no other things left to complete other than checking the boxes under "Legal Stuff".  (If you have not done the config, you can manually fill that in on the Configuration tab OR alter anything if you do not want to use the default items)

3.5.3 Once all the mandatory items is completed, click on the "Generate Code From Template" button.  This will add the code to the Program.cs file in the build project, commit the code to GitHub and create a Pull Request.

You will then see a console box appear and disappear as scripts are executed and once done, you will see some tasks/actions for things that may need doing that are not automated.

3.5.6 Close the form

3.5.7 Open GitHub and review the Pull Request.  
- You will notice that GitHub are aware of the new yaml file `github/workflows/dotnet.yml` and that the agent is currently checking the build.
- If anything needs amending, you can add your commits to this branch, otherwise if you are satisfied the code can be merged.

#### 3.6. Logging Broker

3.6.1. Next we will do the Logging Broker, so back in Visual Studio, press CTRL + SHIFT + F4 to bring up the Code Generator.

3.6.2. Find the Logging Broker either via search or the Template Drop Down

3.6.3. Check the boxes under "Legal Stuff" and click on the "Generate Code From Template" button.

3.6.4. Once done, you will see the tasks / action messages again as before and this time we have one manual task to complete, so lets do that now...
- Close the form
- You will notice that you are currently in the `users/%GitHub Username%/brokers-loggers-logcritical` branch.  So navigate to Startup.cs and add the DI registration for LoggingBroker => `services.AddTransient<ILoggingBroker, LoggingBroker>();`

3.6.5 Commit and push this change

3.6.6 Head over to GitHub now to review the Pull Requests in order.  (If needed, you can add further commits to any of the branches if needed)

- You will notice that when you get to pull request "BROKERS: Logging - Log Critical", that the CODE RUB is in the COMMIT history
